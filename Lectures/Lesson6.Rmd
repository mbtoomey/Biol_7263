Up to now we have been working with single datasets that are "tidy" and organized in a way that make them easy to work with in `R` and the `tidyverse` family of packages. In this lesson we will introduce tools that can help you transform "messy" data into tidy data.  

### The three rules of tidy data  

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

![A schematic of tidy data organization reproduced from chapter 12 of Wickham and Grolemund, R for Data Science ](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png)

### Benefits of tidy data  

1. Easily adapt old scripts to process new data
2. Variables as columns allows you to easily use vectorized functions

### Pivoting 

Two common problems encounter in non-tidy data are: 

1. One variable might be spread across multiple columns.
2. One observation might be scattered across multiple rows.

The [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) package in the `tidyverse` provides tools to pivot and reoraganize data tables that can quickly resolve these problems. 

### Column name to a string varaible

The `relig_income` is a built-in dataset, in the `tidyverse` that included counts from a survey of religion and annual income.

```{r eval=FALSE}
relig_income
```

- each row is a different `religion`
- the `income` variable is spread across the column headers 
- the `count` values are individual cells

To make this tidy data we need to convert to three columns: 

- `religion`
- `income` 
- `count` 

We want to *long* dataset with many rows that are each a unique observation. To do this we can `pivot_long`

```{r eval=FALSE}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("<$10k", "$10-20k", "$20-30k", "$30-40k", "$40-50k", "$50-75k", "$75-100k", "$100-150k", ">150k", "Don't know/refused"), names_to = "income", values_to = "count")

#We can simplify this by specifying the range of columns
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = "<$10k":"Don't know/refused", names_to = "income", values_to = "count")

#We can simplify this by selected the "not religion" rather than specifying all of the columns individually
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count")
```

The first argument is the dataset  we want to pivot `relig_income`. We then pipe that to the the `pivot_long` function

In `pivot_long`:  

- First we specify the columns to be pivoted.  
- Then indicate that the column names should become a variable called `income`  
- Finally indicate that the values in the cells should become observations of a variable called `count`.

### Column name to a numeric varaible

Some messy datasets may contain numeric values in the column names. Pivot contains tools that makes it easy to extract and format these values. 

The `billboard` dataset contains the top 100 rankings each week for songs release in the year 2000. In this dataset each week is a column, but we would like week to be a single column numeric variable. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), #pivot all columns with names beginning with "wk"
    names_to = "week", #convert column names to a variable called week
    values_to = "rank", #reorganize observations in each column into a variable called rank
    values_drop_na = TRUE #drop NAs from the pivoted data set
  )
```

If you look at the variable types week is a <chr> not a numeric variable. We need to parse `week` further to get the output we want. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), #pivot all columns with names beginning with "wk"
    names_to = "week", #convert column names to a variable called week
    names_prefix = "wk", #this command strips off the "wk" prefie from the column name
    names_transform = list(week = as.integer), #this option transforms the variable type from a string to integer
    values_to = "rank", #reorganize observations in each column into a variable called rank
    values_drop_na = TRUE, #drop NAs from the pivoted data set
  )
```

### Column name contains multiple variables  

In the `who` data set the column names contain three variables:   

- A prefix that indicates these are new cases `new/new_`. This is the same for all observations and can de dropped.  
- A diagnosis method: `sp/rel/ep` 
- Gender `m/f`  
- Age range: `014/1524/2535/3544/4554/65` 

We can use regular expression within the pivit function to parse these into separate variables: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
who %>% pivot_longer(
  cols = new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, #specify the range of columns to pivot
  names_to = c("diagnosis", "gender", "age"), #specify the new names for the variables that will be extracted from the column names
  names_pattern = "new_?(.*)_(.)(.*)", #use "("")" to select elements of the regular expression. Here the "?" indicates 0 or 1 "_" is possible after "new". 
  values_to = "count"
)
```

### Columns are multiple observations of same individuals   

For this example we will generate a sample data set called family: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
family <- tribble(
  ~family,  ~dob_child1,  ~dob_child2, ~gender_child1, ~gender_child2,
       1L, "1998-11-26", "2000-01-29",             1L,             2L,
       2L, "1996-06-22",           NA,             2L,             NA,
       3L, "2002-07-11", "2004-04-05",             2L,             2L,
       4L, "2004-10-10", "2009-08-27",             1L,             1L,
       5L, "2000-12-05", "2005-02-28",             2L,             1L,
)
family <- family %>% mutate_at(vars(starts_with("dob")), parse_date)

# A tibble: 5 x 5
  family dob_child1 dob_child2 gender_child1 gender_child2
   <int> <date>     <date>             <int>         <int>
1      1 1998-11-26 2000-01-29             1             2
2      2 1996-06-22 NA                     2            NA
3      3 2002-07-11 2004-04-05             2             2
4      4 2004-10-10 2009-08-27             1             1
5      5 2000-12-05 2005-02-28             2             1
```

In this data set we have both `dob` and `gender` observations for child #1 and #2. We would like to tidy this, create a new variable `child` and have single `dob` and `gender` variables. Again, pivot gives us options to do this: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
family %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    col = !family, #pivot columns that are not family
    names_to = c(".value", "child"), #transform column names to two variables. The special name ".value" tells pivot_longer() that that part of the column name specifies the “value” being measured (which will become a variable in the output) 
    names_sep = "_", #This tells pivot_longer() to split the column names at the "_". 
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )

```

### `pivot_wider()`

In cases where you have observations spread across multiple rows, you can tidy these by widening the dataset with `pivot_wider()`

The built in dataset called `table2` contains data on the population of a country and the number of cases of a disease observed, but the observations are collected in a single column `count` and labeled as population or cases by the the column `type`. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
table2
```

What we want are two new columns named population and cases that contain the values in the `count` column.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
table2 %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```
___

### Separating one column to many

Sometimes you will encounter data sets where a single column contains two or more values. These can be pulled apart with the `separate()` function. 

For example, `table 3` is a version of `table 2` where the cases and population are expressed as `rate`.

```{r}
table3
```

We can create separate `cases` and `population` variables by splitting rate at the "/". 

```{r eval=FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```

However, since `rate` was a character vector, the split columns are now character vectors which is not what we want. We can change them to integers by including the `convert = TRUE` option. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
```

`convert` will apply the classification rules we discussed in the data import section of [Lesson 5](Lectures/Lesson5.html). 

A common problem you might encounter is that someone has mixed data entries with sample notes in a single cell. `separate()` can help you here.

Let's make a small example data set `field_notes` 

```{r}
field_notes<-tibble(
  ID = c(023, 456, 167, 897), 
  sex = c("F","F","M","F"),
  mass = c("15.6 first sample of the day","16.0","17.2 caught with female 456","14.9 last sample of the day"))

field_notes
```

Notice that mass also contains sample notes and everything is separated by a space. We would like separate coloumns for mass and notes. We can separate by space, but this does not do exactly what we would like. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
field_notes %>% 
  separate(mass, 
           into = c("mass","notes"), 
           sep = " ")
```

It only recovers one of the words from the mote. `separate` has an option `extra` that allows you to merge the extra stuff into the second column: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
field_notes %>% 
  separate(mass, 
           = c("mass","notes"), 
           sep = " ", 
           extra = "merge")
```

This is almost what we want but the mass is still being treated as a string. We need to convert to have it treated as numeric (double). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
field_notes_sep<-field_notes %>% 
  separate(mass, 
           into = c("mass","notes"), 
           sep = " ", 
           extra = "merge", 
           convert = TRUE)

field_notes_sep
```

### Merging  columns with `unite()`

`unite()` is the inverse of `separate()` and brings many columns togerther into one. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
field_notes_sep %>% 
  unite(col = ID_sex, ID, sex)
```

By default `unite()` joins the values in the columns with an `"_"` and deletes the joined columns. However, we can control this behavior by changing the options. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
field_notes_sep %>% 
  unite(col = ID_sex, ID, sex,
    sep = "&",  #this specifies a "&" as the separator
    remove = FALSE)  #this will retain the joined columns in the result
```
