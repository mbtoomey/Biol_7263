These tools are designed to help you merge and compare multiple data sets accurately and efficiently. 

### Mutating joins

Mutating joins add new variables to a data set from another data set that match observations in in a **key** variable in each data set.

There are four different types of mutating joins:  

- `inner_join(x,y)` - joins matching observations in both x and y 
- Outer joins  
  - `left_join(x,y)` - joins all observations in x and adds matching observations from y. By default will add NAs where observations from x have no match in y. 
  - `right_join(x,y)`- joins all observations in y and adds matching observations in x. By default will add NAs where observations from y have no match in x.
  - `full_join(x,y)` - joins all observations from x and all observations from y. By default will add NAs where matching observations are missing in eaither x or y.

Examples from the [vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)

We have two data sets `band_members` and `band_instruments` that share a key "name"

```{r message=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
band_members
band_instruments
```

Try each type mutating join function following this general template: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
band_members %>%
  <some join function> (band_instruments, by = "name")
```

The joining variable name of the keys does not necessarily need to be the same, but that values must match.

```{r}
band_instruments2 # in this data set the key variable is called artist
```

We can join this by specifying the keys in the `by` option

```{r eval=FALSE}
band_members %>% 
  full_join(band_instruments2, by = c("name" = "artist"))
```

If you want to retain the "artist" variable you can specify `keep=TRUE`


```{r eval=FALSE}
band_members %>% 
  full_join(band_instruments2, by = c("name" = "artist"), keep=TRUE)
```

### Filtering joins

Filtering joins allow you to filter one date set based on the presence or absence of matches in a second data set. This is a great way to investigate large data sets for missing observations. 

- `semi_join(x,y)` returns all rows from x with a match in y.
- `anti_join(x,y)` returns all rows from x without a match in y.

Try each on the band data set: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
band_members %>%
  <some filter join function> (band_instruments, by = "name")
```

### Set operations

These are similar to filter joins but work on **complete rows** comparing the value of every variable. This can be helpful if you have multiple copies of a data set and want to find where there are similarities and differences between them. 

- `intersect(x, y)` - return only observations in both x and y.
- `union(x, y)` - return unique observations in x and y.
- `setdiff(x, y)` - return observations in x, but not in y.
