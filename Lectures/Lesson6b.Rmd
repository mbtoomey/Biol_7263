In this lesson we will introduce tools that can help you merge multiple data sets accurately and efficiently. 

### Mutating joins

Mutating joins add new variables to a data set from matching observations in another data set.

There are four different types of mutating joins:  

- `inner_join(x,y)` - joins matching observations in both x and y 
- Outer joins  
  - `left_join(x,y)` - joins all observations in x and adds matching observations from y. By default will add NAs where observations from x have no match in y. 
  - `right_join(x,y)`- joins all observations in y and adds matching observations in x. By default will add NAs where observations from y have no match in x.
  - `full_join(x,y)` - joins all observations from x and all observations from y. By default will add NAs where matching observations are missing in eaither x or y.

Examples from the [vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)

We have two data sets `band_members` and `band_instruments` that share a "name key
