## `dplyr` exercises

For these exercise download and import the data files containing my Ebird observations from here: https://github.com/mbtoomey/Biol_7263/blob/main/Data/MBT_ebird.csv?raw=true

Using the functions in `dplyr` and base `R` answer the following questions. Create a mark down files that documents the answer and the code you used to answer the question. Also include a link the a commented R script where all of the code can be run to reproduce your answers

1. In which year did I observe the most individual birds? How many?

2. In that year how many different species of birds did I observe? 

3. In which state did I most frequently observe Red-winged Blackbirds? 

4. Filter observations for a duration between 5 and 200 minutes. Calculate the mean rate per checklist that I encounter species each year. Specifically, calculate the number of species in each checklist divided by time and then take the mean for the year. 

5. Create a data frame that includes the complete observations for the top 10 most frequently observed species. First generate a top 10 list and then use this list to filter all observations.
