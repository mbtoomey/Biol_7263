## `tidyr` and merge exercise

For these exercise download and import these two csv files:  

- [Part1](https://github.com/mbtoomey/Biol_7263/blob/main/Data/assignment6part1.csv)

- [Part2](https://github.com/mbtoomey/Biol_7263/blob/main/Data/assignment6part2.csv)

1. Pivot and merge these two data sets into a single tidy tibble. Export this tibble as a `.csv` file saved to a folder called "Results" folder within your R project. 

2. With this tidy tibble, generate a new tibble of the mean +/- standard deviation of the residual mass (mass/body length) by treatment and sex. Export this tibble as a `.csv` file saved to a folder called "Results" folder within your R project. 

In an Rmarkdown document present the code you used to pivot, merge, etc. and the links to the commented R script and final `.csv` files stored in your Data folder. Knit this to an html file and link on your portfolio page.
